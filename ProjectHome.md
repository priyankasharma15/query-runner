In my testing experience, I have seen that some of the queries are used very frequently on different environments for testing and data verification purpose. Good amount of time is spent in connecting to database, writing the query and executing it.  So in order to reduce the time spent in these repetitive activities, I have developed this web Application which is very helpful in getting the result from frequently used queries run on different environment.

This application shows the result of the executed query within seconds, without much effort and saves the time involved in activities like connecting database, writing the query and executing it.

Application has several feature such as -
  1. User Login functionality to stop unauthorized access
  1. You can add as many connection as you want to.
  1. You can also edit the connection you already have.
  1. You can add as many Queries as you want to.
  1. You can also edit the Queries you already have.
  1. Select from list of several database connection information stored.
  1. Select any of the several queries which can be run on a click of a button.
  1. Display of result of the query within seconds.
  1. Provide input parameter to the query in a pop-up window.

Below given are the screenshots of the application features .
