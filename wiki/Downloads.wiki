Google code hosting does not hosts the binary files for projects. The binary files for query runner can be downloaded from my public google drive share:

The content of the query-runner.zip is:
* query-runner.war
* setup.sql

* LICENSE.txt

See the Setup Instructions page for how to setup and run query-runner.
